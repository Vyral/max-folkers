testimonial:
  - quote: I was going to co-own a property but I was a little nervous about making the down payment because that was much more than I had in fluid cash. I told Max that I had a condo in North Park and he told me that it would sell in 10 days and he sold it in a weekend. It was just his knowledge of the market and patience that helped everything go along. He steered us in the right direction and looked out for our interests even though we didn’t realized that’s what he was doing.

  - quote: My original plan was to list my house in April, sell it in June, and move in July. What actually happened was that we sold it immediately and had to move sooner than expected, which was a good thing! Before Max even listed it, he had gone out and scouted some people that he thought might be interested in buying it. I’ve sold several houses in my life and this transaction definitely went the smoothest. I truly felt I could call him at all hours and he was very responsive to me.

  - quote: Max is a top-notch agent. You cannot go wrong working with him to sell or buy a home. He has an outstanding marketing campaign that works to sell homes quickly, and has very good negotiating skills that deliver. The best quality about Max is that he truly cares about his clients. He's easy to work with and other agents really enjoy working with him, too. Max makes the escow process smooth. I would definitely recommend Max to my family and friends.

  - quote: Before choosing Max as my listing agent, I interviewed several agents. Max was prompt to the initial interview, honest, not pushy, and seemed relaxed and willing to provide his knowledge about the current real esate market. After choosing Max as my listing agent, he was quick to have a person over at my place to help stage my home, had a professional photographer take great pictures, and had my home on the MLS expeditiously. During the offer process, Max offered his advice but always let me make the final decision without making me feel awkward. He is tech savvy and I was able to complete most of the transaction electronically. He has a full-time assistant who is prompt and willing to help when need be. The escrow process was very smooth and Max kept in close communication throughout the entire process. At the end, Max was able to take my property from initial listing to complete sale within two months! Thanks Max for helping make the sale of my home a smooth process!

  - quote: The reasons Max and Team Folkers consistently rate in the top 1% of Realtors for production, and most importantly voted "5 Star" for customer satisfaction, are very clear after working with him for the last 8-9 months (!!!). Max is a true professional, a humble man with integrity and humor, and   most of all a "friendly neighborhood guy" who happens to be one of the very best at what he does. You are getting more than just a great RE pro, you are getting a great human being to work with.

  - quote: Max and his team were FANTASTIC. Ultra-responsive, efficient, attention-to-detail oriented, professional and most importantly easy to work with. They were attentive, never pushy, always helpful and a pleasure to work with. I would (and have) recommended Max to my friends looking to buy or sell a   home.

    name: Vivek

  - quote: My husband and I met Max and were immediately impressed that he was very knowledgeable, down-to-earth, and helpful.  He truly wants to help you find the house you are looking for and doesn't act like a "tour guide," like many others do when looking at homes for sale.  Max's whole team was   extremely helpful from start to finish and we thoroughly enjoyed working with them!  We highly recommend using Max for your next home purchase!

  - quote: If you want the best, select Max Folkers! He sets a high bar in the Real estate industry. He is knowledgeable, has a  calming personality and works toward your best interests. While walking my dog, I met Max almost a year ago (2016) and had a casual conversation with him.  I was impressed at the   time and never forgot him.  When I decided to sell my townhouse (2017) I called him.  The process was smooth and seamless. He and his team were kind, considerate and responsive. Thank you Max! You are an awesome person!
    name: Mimi

  - quote: Max is great. He helped us narrow down what we really valued and helped out that together in a complex market. He worked w my wife while she was in Mew Mexico and worked back and forth between us, that takes patience and a heart. Real estate is an expensive proposition, work with someone that you   can trust and that is personable. Max is both. You won’t be disappointed.
    name: Carlos

  - quote: We contacted Max after seeing his ad on Zillow and visiting his website. He responded promptly to our inquiry about a specific property and helped navigate us through multiple offers, a broken contract, and the purchase of our new home. In truth, it was his efforts that ensured we closed on our   house and we are grateful for his expertise. Honest, unflappable, and determined. Max is the realtor you want to successfully navigate the home market in San Diego. Thank you Max and thank you to your team!

  - quote: Finding a home with Max Folkers was the best experience we’ve had with a realtor to date. Working with Max was like looking for a home with a close, trusted friend who had your best interest in mind. Who happens to know the San Diego market cold. Max was cool, patient, honest, and responsive. He   never pressured us once, and took painstaking time and effort to ensure we were smart on making our decision.  In return, we found a wonderful home in a great neighborhood.

  - quote: Max and his team helped us buy our first home and we could not have asked for a better experience.  They were very helpful and understanding with all of our questions.  We were able to buy the home we wanted despite multiple offers on the home.  Max was very easy to reach if we had questions and   really made the whole process a breeze!
