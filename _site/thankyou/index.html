What actually happened was that we sold it immediately and had to move sooner than expected, which was a good thing! Before Max even listed it, he had gone out and scouted some people that he thought might be interested in buying it. Iâve sold several houses in my life and this transaction definitely went the smoothest. I truly felt I could call him at all hours and he was very responsive to me.</p>

		            <p class="testimonial">Before choosing Max as my listing agent, I interviewed several agents. Max was prompt to the initial interview, honest, not pushy, and seemed relaxed and willing to provide his knowledge about the current real esate market. After choosing Max as my listing agent, he was quick to have a person over at my place to help stage my home, had a professional photographer take great pictures, and had my home on the MLS expeditiously. During the offer process, Max offered his advice but always let me make the final decision without making me feel awkward. He is tech savvy and I was able to complete most of the transaction electronically. He has a full-time assistant who is prompt and willing to help when need be. The escrow process was very smooth and Max kept in close communication throughout the entire process. At the end, Max was able to take my property from initial listing to complete sale within two months! Thanks Max for helping make the sale of my home a smooth process!</p>

		            <p class="testimonial">Finding a home with Max Folkers was the best experience weâve had with a realtor to date. Working with Max was like looking for a home with a close, trusted friend who had your best interest in mind. Who happens to know the San Diego market cold. Max was cool, patient, honest, and responsive. He   never pressured us once, and took painstaking time and effort to ensure we were smart on making our decision.  In return, we found a wonderful home in a great neighborhood.</p>
