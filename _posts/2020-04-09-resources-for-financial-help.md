I hope you’re staying safe and sane here in the coronavirus era. Today I want to share some economic resources in case you’ve been impacted financially by the health crisis. Specifically, I’m talking about three things: mortgage payments, if you’re a small business owner with employees, and if you rent your home. First, I’ll discuss the CARES Act, which stands for the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. If you have a mortgage, the CARES Act says banks are allowed to give you a three-month deferral on your payments.
