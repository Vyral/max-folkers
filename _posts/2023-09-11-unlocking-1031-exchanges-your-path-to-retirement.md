I'm super excited to introduce a special guest speaker who will shed light on 1031 exchanges, unveiling some intriguing options you might not have considered. This serves as a preview for an exciting event we have lined up on October 11th at 6 p.m.

**What's the Event About?**

This event will last for about an hour, and we're thrilled to have Jason, a managing partner with 1031 Capital Solutions, in person to share invaluable insights. If you own investment properties or know someone who does, this event is a must-attend. So, Jason, over to you!

**Retiring from Landlording with 1031 Exchanges**

Jason, from 1031 Capital Solutions, explains how they assist people in retiring from the landlord life. Their approach involves guiding individuals on selling their rental properties through a 1031 Exchange, typically with the help of real estate professionals. They then reinvest the sales proceeds into a Delaware Statutory Trust (DST).

**Benefits of DST Investments**

DSTs offer passive investments that qualify as replacement properties in a 1031 exchange. Investors can still enjoy the perks of real estate ownership, including potential monthly cash flow, appreciation, and various tax benefits, all without the hassles of active property management. This option suits accredited investors who have been in the real estate game for a while and are seeking an exit strategy.

**The Changing Real Estate Landscape**

Jason highlights the evolving challenges of being a landlord, particularly in California. With statewide rent control and stringent tenant protection laws, landlords face increasing hurdles. Legislative changes like AB 12, limiting security deposits, add to the complexity. Many property owners are now exploring exit strategies for their real estate investments.

**Join Us on October 11th!**

This brief conversation only scratches the surface of what Jason will cover in-depth during our event on October 11th at 6 p.m. We have a fantastic event space at our office, and you won't want to miss the eye-opening insights Jason has to offer.
