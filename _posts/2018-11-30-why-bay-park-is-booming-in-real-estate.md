Bay Park is booming right now, and for my latest appearance on “The American Dream,” host Sarah Pilla and I visited one of the best restaurants in the area, Luce, to talk about why.

First, though, we talked with Luce’s owner Sal D’Amato about his restaurant. I’ve lived in this area for 15 years, and I’m excited to see another great restaurant open. Our office is located right across the street from Luce, so I’m there all the time.

Sal’s father was a restauranter, so he grew up in the business. He and his brother opened Luce six years ago, and they’re still going strong. As a gastropub, they serve more than just bar food. Their menu changes seasonally, but they’re best known for their burgers.

Their daily happy hour runs from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. for food and from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. for drinks.
Aside from their weekly lunch and dinner schedule, they also serve brunch on the weekends. At the moment, they’re converting a former adjoining parking lot into a nice patio area with a firepit and its own bar, and it should be open by September.

Moving on to our main topic, Bay Park has really hit the map lately in the real estate industry. As one of the original master-planned communities of San Diego, its development dates all the way back to 1950s. Though the area has seen a lot of turnover, there’re still a lot of original residents living here along with the new families settling in.

One of the main benefits of Bay Park is its walkability. You can find decent-sized houses on the market that have a water view and are within walking distance of many restaurants, bars, coffee shops, etc. You’re also close enough to the Bay that you can ride your bike to get there if you like. Relative to the prices we’re seeing in areas like La Jolla, Point Loma, or Pacific Beach, you can find a lot of great deals here.

With the new trolley stops slated to open here in a few years, Bay Park is drawing even more attention, and there will be even more things to see and do in the future.

If you’re interested in checking out the available homes in this area, don’t hesitate to give me a call. If you have any other real estate questions, feel free to reach out to me as well. I’d love to help you.
