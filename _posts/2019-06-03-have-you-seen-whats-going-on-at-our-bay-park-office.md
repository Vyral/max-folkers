  Our Bay Park office has many amenities, but none are better than the “man
  cave” that we’ve turned into a community event center. Here’s a better look at
  the space so you can see why it’s so incredible.

On my latest appearance on “The American Dream," I joined host Lili Fifield and Darlene De La Paz from Pazable Creations in our Bay Park office to talk a little bit about the area and to take a closer look at our own little secret place in our office.&nbsp;

**From cornhole to ping pong to plenty of TVs, we’ve created our own little man cave here at RE/MAX Pacific.&nbsp;**However, now we want to make it a center for the community.&nbsp;

We’ve already had private events in it and we’re actually leasing it out now for events. There’s a ton of space to hang out, play ping pong, and even play with your pets.&nbsp;**See for yourself starting at 1:30 in the video above.**<br><br>{% include pullquote.html %}

We’d love for you to come check out the space for yourself some time. If you’re in the area here in Bay Park, come take a little break and join us\!&nbsp;

If you have any other questions for me in the meantime or any real estate needs that I can assist you with, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
