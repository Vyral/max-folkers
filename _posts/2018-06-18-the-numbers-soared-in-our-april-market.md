We just received the latest San Diego market numbers from this past April, and we’ve reached some new highs in a few different categories.

The first is median home price, which ended April at a brand-new high of $570,000. Prior to that, the record was $517,000, which was set all the way back in November 2005. In case you’re wondering, the all-time low for the median home price in San Diego is $280,000, which was set in November 2009. This means our market more than doubled our all-time low.

The second (and less exciting) high came from interest rates, which reached 4.5% for a 30-year fixed rate. This wasn’t a record high, but it was the highest point we’d seen in the past seven years.

As a matter of fact, it’s that high that may have contributed to our next high—the number of active homes on the market. At the end of April, we had approximately 6,500 homes on the market.

The inflow and outflow of homes on the market is cyclical, and it’s not uncommon for this number to increase during this time of year. With both rising interest rates and rising prices hampering affordability, though, it will be interesting to see how this number evolves throughout the rest of the year.
