If you’ve been searching for a new home in one of the most desirable parts of Bay Park, this is a property you’ll want to see. I’m excited to share a brand new construction listing that offers space, comfort, and a location that supports everyday living.

Homes like this rarely come to the market, and when they do, they draw attention quickly because they offer the features buyers value most. This one sits in the heart of Bay Park, close to schools, parks, and the essentials that make life convenient and straightforward.

**I want to walk you through the key details so you can get a clear sense of what makes this home stand out from the moment you step inside.**

**A full home built for daily comfort.** As soon as you enter the home, you notice how much space you have to move and live. The layout includes four bedrooms and three and a half baths, giving you room for family, guests, or a dedicated office if you work from home. Each bedroom offers generous space, and the shared living areas are designed to make daily routines feel natural and easy.

Because this is a full new construction, every part of the home meets modern standards, with new systems, new finishes, and no hidden updates waiting for you after you move in. It’s built to give you both comfort and peace of mind.

**A detached ADU that adds real value.** One of the most important features of this property is the detached ADU, which stands for Accessory Dwelling Unit. An ADU is a small, separate living space on the same property as the main home. Many buyers want an ADU because it offers flexibility that supports different stages of life.

You can use it as private housing for guests or family members, as a rental unit to generate income, or as a workspace that gives you privacy away from the main house. It’s rare to find a new construction home in this area that comes with a detached ADU already built, and it adds real long-term value to the property.

**A great location near schools and parks.** The home is located at 1860 Ilion Street, directly across from The Madeline School, which makes mornings easier if you have school-aged children. The neighborhood is known for its peaceful streets, friendly feel, and easy access to Mission Bay, local shopping, dining, and major commuter routes. Bay Park has always been a high-demand area, and this home sits in a location that enhances both your lifestyle and your day-to-day routine.

**A view that completes the experience.** We ended our preview of this listing with the view, as it’s one of the property’s highlights. The outlook gives you a sense of calm and connection to the neighborhood, and it’s the kind of feature you get to enjoy every day. Views like this are lasting and add to the overall appeal of the home in a meaningful way.

New construction homes with four bedrooms, three and a half baths, a detached ADU, and a prime Bay Park location are very rare, and this one brings all of those features together in a way that makes it easy to imagine yourself living here.<br><br>If you’d like to see this home in person or have any questions, feel free to call or text me at [**<u>(619) 977-8364</u>**](tel:6199778364) or email me at [**<u>team@maxfolkers.com</u>**](mailto:team@maxfolkers.com).
