Could now be the best time ever to sell a home in San Diego? It might be, and today I want to tell you why.&nbsp;

If you check out the video at 0:34, you can see all the statistics for San Diego’s housing market. If you’ve been paying attention, **it won’t surprise you to learn that prices are at an all-time high.** The average San Diego home is worth about $760,000; that’s 16.9% more than the prior year.&nbsp;

Meanwhile, **the active number of listings is down 52% year over year,** so our inventory is extremely low. You can also see in the graph at 1:29 that December is traditionally the low point for new listings, so things will only get more scarce.&nbsp;

What this means for you is that you will have almost no competition in a very active market. You can probably see why I think now is the best time ever to sell a house.&nbsp;

One important thing to mention is that homes will likely continue to appreciate for a while. If you have a home that needs a little work done, a couple of fixes could get your home ready for an even crazier market. I have a great contractor prepared to get your home ready for the market, so reach out to me if you’re thinking about listing.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about today’s video, please feel free to call or email me. I am always willing to help in any way I can\!
