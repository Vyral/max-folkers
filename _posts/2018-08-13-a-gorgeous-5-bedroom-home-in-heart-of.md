I just wanted to take a moment of your time to let you know about a fantastic new home that was just listed on the market. 3626 Lloyd Terrace is in one of my favorite areas of the city, and I recently sat down for an episode of “Smarter San Diego” to discuss it.

This 2,799 square foot home is down in Bay Park and has five bedrooms and three bathrooms. In the video above, you'll see that the home has ample space for living, entertaining, and more. The open floor plan really capitalized the space, and it’s right near the water as well.

If you’d like to schedule a tour of this property for yourself or if you have any questions about it, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
