Are you caught in the classic buyer's dilemma? You've found your dream home, but you need to sell your current one first. It's a common situation that can make securing your next home feel like a daunting challenge. But we have a fantastic solution that can make this process smoother for you: an innovative program offered by our partner, Home Lite: the Buy Before You Sell program.

**With the Buy Before You Sell program, you can access the equity tied up in your existing home.** This equity can then be used to make a competitive, non-contingent offer on your next home. By eliminating the need to wait for your current home to sell, you gain a significant advantage in today's competitive market. You can also use your unlocked funds for moving costs, closing fees, and any necessary home improvements.

This option lets you move into your new home without the hassle of managing showings or disruptions in your current space, and once you've settled into your new home, we'll help prepare and stage your previous home for sale, potentially increasing its value by up to 10%.

**Here are a few scenarios where the Buy Before You Sell program could be a game-changer:**

* You're in a competitive market with multiple offers, and you need to act fast with a non-contingent offer.
* Managing showings is challenging due to family commitments or pet ownership.
* Health issues make it difficult to facilitate the selling process while transitioning to a new home.
* Your current home needs work or decluttering to maximize its market appeal.
