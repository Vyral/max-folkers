For my latest appearance on “The American Dream,” I’m joined by co-host Hallie Loren as we visit VIP NeuroRehab, a nonprofit physical therapy clinic run by my good friend David Charbonnet.&nbsp;

This clinic specializes in helping people with neurological conditions. Just like any able-bodied person needs to exercise to maintain good health, people with neurological conditions need to exercise too, except in a more specific way, and **VIP NeuroRehab provides the training and equipment they require to live life to the fullest. &nbsp;**

Before David took over as president of this nonprofit, he was a patient himself. He suffered a parachuting accident while he was in the military, and his physical therapist recommended VIP NeuroRehab.&nbsp;

As a nonprofit, one of their goals is to provide the cheapest and most affordable care that they can to their patients. One of the ways they reduce costs is through fundraisers, and they have another one coming up on October 5 that you won’t want to miss.&nbsp;

This event is a send-off party to the organization Beyond the Teams, which is a group of former Navy SEALs who will be riding their bicycles 1,000 miles from Virginia Beach, Virginia, to Fort Pierce, Florida, later in October to benefit VIP NeuroRehab.&nbsp;

**This fundraiser will be held at our office (4114 Napier Street, San Diego, 92110) from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.** We’ll be doing a trivia night, and plenty of food and drinks will be provided. To find out more, visit [vipneurorehab.org](https://www.vipneurorehab.org/){: target="_blank"}.&nbsp;

If you have any questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you. I hope to see you there\!<br>&nbsp;
