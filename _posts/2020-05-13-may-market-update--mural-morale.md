*We’ll help paint a picture of the market, and you can help us paint a mural.*

A recent report from Zillow forecasts a 2% to 3% decrease in home prices this year. Top NAR economist Lawrence Yun countered that with a projection of 1.3% growth over the course of 2020. Of course, that’s all on a national level, and we know real estate is hyperlocal—what’s been the story here?

**We’ve seen the number of inquiries jump dramatically over the last seven to 10 days.** As the weather improves and the economy starts to open back up, more and more people are thinking about returning to the housing market.&nbsp;

The number of mortgage applications to purchase have jumped up by 7% over the past week alone, offering another encouraging indicator that buyer activity is rising. It helps that affordability has gotten better thanks to interest rates having once again hit a historic low.&nbsp;

At 1:43 in the video above, you’ll see a graph chronicling median sale prices over the past three years. **As of April 2020, the median sale price is $600,000, up 3.4% year over year.** These figures take into account transactions that took place after the shelter-in-place ordinances went into effect, meaning that prices continue to rise despite unprecedented conditions caused by the coronavirus.&nbsp;

Listings are down nearly 30% year over year, and new listings in particular have dropped off by 41%—the yearly real estate cycle of slower and busier seasons has been broken. That being said, the lack of inventory is expected to keep demand high and prices stout.&nbsp;

If you’re thinking about buying, **we’d be happy to arrange virtual tours or in-person showings with adequate PPE and social distancing protocols**. These are strange times to buy or sell, but real estate is certainly still moving.&nbsp;

To end things on a positive note, I’m excited to share that **we have a mural that needs to be redone.** Benchmark Brewing left behind a large mural on their building in the heart of Bay Park after unfortunately going bankrupt. We want to put up a new, vinyl-printed copy to hopefully lift our community’s spirit through art. The new mural could be one large piece or a collage of several smaller images. If you have some awesome ideas for a mural you’d like to share with us, send over a sketch. We’ll get them all printed out so they can be voted on\!&nbsp;

In the meantime, give us a call or shoot an email if we can help you out in any way. We’re always here to be a resource for you.
