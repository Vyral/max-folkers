What does our real estate market look like in this era of COVID-19? It’s the tale of two cities: On one hand, there’s a lot of fear, uncertainty, and transactions being canceled, while on the other hand, there is still really low inventory, low interest rates, and opportunistic buyers making moves. The virus has changed how we do things (e.g., virtual tours instead of open houses), **but we’re still serving buyers’ and sellers’ needs in the market**. If you have any questions for us during these unusual times, please don’t hesitate to reach out. We’d love to hear from you.
