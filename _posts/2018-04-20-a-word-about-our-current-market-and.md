Right now we’re deep into the buying season. For the last several years, April, May, and June have been the busiest months of the year, which is good for buyers because it means more inventory is coming on the market. It’s also good for sellers because it means a lot of buyers are making their move before summer vacation hits and before the school year starts. At the moment, it’s not uncommon to see listed houses attract multiple offers and sell for over asking price.

Another important development to keep in mind is rent costs. I read an article recently that stated that the average San Diego rental is now over $1,800, which is a 23% increase over the last three years. Because of this, many people are looking at their rent costs, scratching their heads, and wondering whether now is the time to get off the fence.

This trend is pushing people into the lower end of the market, and it brings me to our next topic.

If you’re thinking of buying your first home or you’d like a refresher on how to buy a home in our market, you’re invited to attend our upcoming home buying seminar on Thursday, April 26 right here at our office at 4114 Napier Street, San Diego, California, 92110.

This seminar will run from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. We’ll discuss what interest rates look like right now, share some great down payment programs that are available, show you how to get your offer accepted in a competitive market like ours, and review what happens during the home buying process once you get your offer under contract.

Pizza and refreshments will also be provided (if you know us, you know that means beer and wine). We look forward to a great turnout, and we look forward to seeing you there. To RSVP, click on this link.

If you have any questions about our market or our this event, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help.
