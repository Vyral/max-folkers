I’ve got a few exciting things to share with you today. First, let’s talk about the San Diego real estate market. The Case-Shiller Index, which is the gold standard as far as real estate reporting is concerned, is trending upward, although at a much slower pace than it has been moving. **Appreciation here in San Diego was up just 1.3% this year after increasing by over 6.9% in the previous year.**

The median home price continues to rise and is up to $649,000. However, homes are staying on the market longer and 21% of the homes on the market right now have seen price reductions. Interest rates are back down to 3.8%, which is helping keep things moving along in the market. **We typically see a bump up in activity after Labor Day, but I expect more of the same for the rest of the year.&nbsp;**

The other important thing I wanted to talk to you about was our upcoming event on Thursday, September 12. **It’s an informational happy hour that goes from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. where we’ll talk about accessory dwelling units.** There have been a lot of changes in the past year with this kind of property and the city is really pushing them to promote increased density here in San Diego.&nbsp;

**If you have a regular single-family zoned house, you can now build a second property up to 1,200 sq ft.** There are a few guidelines you have to abide by, but we’ll have Susan Fefferman of maxablespace.com to talk to us about these issues and some financing strategies to consider. [You can RSVP to the event here.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/informational-adu-happy-hour-tickets-67052673351){: target="_blank"}

If you have any questions for me in the meantime about the market or about the event, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
