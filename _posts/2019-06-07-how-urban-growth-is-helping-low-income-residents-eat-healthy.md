Today on “The American Dream,” I’m joined by host Molly O’Dell at the Alpha Square building in Downtown’s East Village to talk with Ivan Corona, the executive director and co-founder of Urban Growth.

Urban Growth is a nonprofit whose mission is to advance the application of hydroponics in urban environments. Alpha Square is a building that was built for permanent supportive housing for low-income residents, **so Urban Growth decided to build a garden on top of their roof so that the residents could enjoy healthy, fresh food.** They call their garden “Project Alpha,” and in the coming months, they plan on doubling their production.&nbsp;

In case you don’t know, hydroponics is the process of growing food without soil. Urban Growth uses a nutrient solution to feed the plants, and since they’re already on the roof, they have all the sunlight they need.&nbsp;

This subject is near and dear to my heart, and **we’re hosting an event at our office on June 15 at 1 p.m. with San Diego Hydroponics & Organics where they’ll be teaching a Hydroponics 101 class.** All the proceeds from this event will go toward helping Urban Growth provide low-income residents with nutritious produce they otherwise wouldn’t be able to afford, so I invite you to join us.&nbsp;
