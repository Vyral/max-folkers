Before we get too far into the new year, I wanted to reach out with a few updates for you. First, I want to tell you about how the real estate market fared in 2017 in San Diego. Then I have a special event to invite you to. Let’s start with a market wrap up from 2017.

The median price for a home in San Diego at the end of 2017 was $540,000. That’s up 9.1% from the previous year. This strong appreciation was mostly driven by the strong economy, as more investors decided to take advantage of the low inventory and low interest rates that we’re currently seeing. In 2018, we expect the low inventory and low interest rate trends to continue.

As for the special event, I just wanted to make sure and invite you out to the grand opening of our new office in Bay Park. It’s really beautiful and we’d love for you to come out and take a look on this Saturday, February 3 from 12:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. We’ve got a big space set aside with artificial turf and we’ll have a lot of different things ready for you, including a bounce castle, a taco cart, giveaways from local businesses, and more. We would love for you to stop by.

If you have any questions for us about the current market or about our grand opening this weekend, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.
