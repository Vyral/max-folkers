I hope you’re all safe and sane as we continue to weather this pandemic. Today I’m sharing a market update and examples of how we’re adjusting to the circumstances. There’s a 27% year-over-year decrease in the amount of new homes coming to market, but prices were actually up 6% for the month of March (though most of those transactions had been set up in January and February). In regard to how we’re getting business done, [virtual tours](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-cIsZq4FYu8j8zy0C-8_PG4IBj_oQK8a/view#100043588) have become crucial (LA actually banned in-person tours). Here in San Diego, you can see a home in-person, we just have to take additional precautions, like face masks, gloves, and physical distancing. To learn more about the technology helping us assist our clients, watch the video above.
