The San Diego real estate market is hot, but one of the hottest areas is Bay Park. I spoke with Derrick Evens, a loan officer, show host, and friend of mine. We remember thinking that Bay Park was an attractive but relatively cheap area a couple of years ago. No longer. We talk about this community’s rapid rise to one of the most desirable areas in San Diego and what the market looks like now.
