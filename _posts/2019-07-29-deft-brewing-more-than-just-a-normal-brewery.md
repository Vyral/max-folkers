For my latest appearance on “The American Dream,” I decided to visit Deft Brewing along with host Jenn Barlow and sit down with co-owner Morris Nuspl to talk about what makes this place such a great addition to the community.&nbsp;

In addition to offering a sophisticated selection of brews any beer connoisseur would appreciate, **Deft is unique in that they foster a family-friendly atmosphere and host many community events** (including a weekly Euchre Night on Tuesdays—a treat for any native Midwesterner). They also host their fair share of fundraisers.&nbsp;

“We like to be one of the community go-to places where people get together and meet each other and hang out,” Morris says. “That’s kind of our dream of this space. More so than just brewing beer and having a cool tasting room, we wanted to really be a community tasting room.”

Most people consider this part of Bay Park an industrial area, but with the trolley expansion, the city is looking at building more housing along the transit corridors, and **the plan is to redevelop the land around where the trolley stop will be built.&nbsp;**

At 3:45 in the video, you can get a quick tour of the facilities and watch as we have our own tasting session. If you’d like to know more about Deft Brewing, you can visit their website [http://deftbrewing.com/](http://deftbrewing.com/){: target="_blank"}.&nbsp;
